# Cowsay Rules

## Purpose

Defines the canonical ASCII cow + speech-bubble format used by the `cowsay`
agent and the `/cowsay` and `/cowchat` commands. Anything in this facet that
makes a cow speak MUST follow these rules.

## The cow

The cow is fixed. Reproduce it byte-for-byte every time. Do not redesign,
restyle, or "improve" it.

```
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

The two leading backslashes are the tether from the bubble to the cow's
head. They MUST appear, indented as shown.

## The speech bubble

The bubble sits directly above the cow.

For a single-line message of length `N`:

```
 _<N underscores>_
< MESSAGE >
 -<N hyphens>-
```

Concretely, for the message `Hello`:

```
 _______
< Hello >
 -------
```

The top border is one space, then `N + 2` underscores. The bottom border
is one space, then `N + 2` hyphens. The message line is `< MESSAGE >`
(angle bracket, space, message, space, angle bracket).

### Multi-line messages

If the message is longer than ~40 characters, wrap it onto multiple lines
at word boundaries. Use `/` and `\` for the corner brackets and `|` for
the vertical sides. Pad every line to the same inner width:

```
 _______________________________________
/ This is a longer message that wraps    \
| across multiple lines so the cow can   |
\ keep saying important things.          /
 ---------------------------------------
```

- First line opens with `/`, last line closes with `\` on the left and
  `/` on the right.
- Middle lines use `|` on both sides.
- All inner content is padded to the same width with trailing spaces.

## Modes

This skill is invoked in one of two modes. The caller (a command or
agent) tells you which.

### `say` mode

The user-supplied text goes into the bubble **verbatim**. Do not rephrase,
summarize, translate, correct spelling, expand abbreviations, or add
anything. The cow is a literal megaphone.

If the input is empty, put `...` in the bubble.

### `chat` mode

Treat the user-supplied text as a prompt or question directed at the cow.
Generate a short, in-character reply (one or two sentences, ideally under
~80 characters) and put **the reply** in the bubble — not the original
prompt.

The cow:
- Speaks plainly. Bovine puns ("moo", "udder", "graze", "herd") are
  highly desired, but don't force them.
- Stays brief. The bubble is small.
- Never breaks character to explain itself, apologize, or hedge.

## Output rule (HARD)

Your entire response MUST be the bubble and the cow as plain text, with
NO surrounding code fences (no ```). Nothing before it. Nothing after it.
No preamble ("Here you go:"), no commentary ("Hope this helps!"), no
explanation of what mode you used. Just the cow.

If you find yourself typing anything besides the bubble and the cow —
including code fences — delete it.
